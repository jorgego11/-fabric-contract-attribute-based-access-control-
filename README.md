# Implement attribute based access control to provide end to end visibility into the supply chain history of a particular product 

##############################################
# ** UPDATE **
We have extended this demo (originally from https://github.com/IBM/fabric-contract-attribute-based-access-control     ) in order to:
* define a 3 Org network
* showcase how to leverage Fabric-CA "affiliations" to show how multiple participants such as "producers" can each get a HL Fabric identity to submit transactions over a common peer. Access control is enforced using the affiliation definition. 

![3-Org Network](images/3orgnetwork.png)


## Change list from original repo
0) Folder structure changes: 
    *   each org is independent from each other and has its own folder
    *   chaincode folder has been moved up one level to make it common for the 3 orgs.

1) Update fabric version to v2.1.1 in chaincode:  ../contract/package.json 
    "dependencies": {
        "fabric-contract-api": "2.1.1",
        "fabric-shim": "2.1.1"
    },

2) Apply this fix to IBP connection profile. (Probably this is required because we are still using SDK "fabric-ca-client": "1.4.0", "fabric-client": "1.4.0",  "fabric-network": "1.4.0")
  change tlsCACerts to a simple string instead of an array, as described here https://github.com/IBM/evote/issues/41#issuecomment-651925530

3) Update chaincode supplychaincontracts.js at line 554 (read the inline comments)

4) For IBP, the client app will use the ../gateway/ibp folder.  In this folder we need to copy the IBP connection profile and update config.json accordingly.

5) To run the Express API server, use the script run_server.sh script that also sets required environment variables . 

Port info:
  Org1 Angular server: 4201     Org1 API server: 3001
  Org2 Angular server: 4202     Org2 API server: 3002
  Org3 Angular server: 4203     Org3 API server: 3003 

6) To run the Angular server, specify the PORT such as:    ng serve --port 420X   where X=1 for Org1, where X=2 for Org2, etc.

7) The following 2 files have been updated to fix the port number to connect to each Express API server. 
orgX/fabric-contract-attribute-based-access-control/application/client/src/app/_services/api.service.ts
orgX/fabric-contract-attribute-based-access-control/application/client/src/app/_services/auth.service.ts

8) Some identities need to be created just to complete the flow. e.g. In the current implementation, the UI will query the local wallet to get list of available shippers
   In a production implementation, the retailers, shippers, producers, etc should be assets in the ledger so they are shared by all organizations.

9) draw.io file depicting the network is provided at the root level. 

10) The use of affiliation for Access Control is shown in the file supplychaincontracts.js  line 422. Inline comments explain the changes. 

11) Scripts under the scripts folder have been updated to have the right port number. 


## Known errors that won't hurt the demo:

1) Error while running Express API server.  This is probably because chaincode lifecycle is still not enabled in IBP v2.5  (It will be in v2.5.1)

   2020-10-16T22:32:04.501Z - error: [Channel.js]: Channel:channel1 received discovery error:failed constructing descriptor for chaincodes:<name:"_lifecycle" >

This sample demonstrates an end to end blockchain application that connects to Hyperledger Fabric 1.4 or the IBM Blockchain Platform. It implements attribute based access control, user management, and a Angular front-end UI to interact and query the blockchain ledger. The 
sample takes the user through ordering, shipping, and enlisting the product for the customer to 
purchase. The customer can trace the order history through the supply chain, providing 
end to end visibility. For example, in the video above, you can see the retailer receiving a shipment, and then a customer logging into the application to see a trace of when the shipment was orderered, shipped, and received. Lastly, a regulator has access to all orders in the system to ensure 
correct practices are followed. 

**Audience level : Intermediate Developers**

### Permissioned blockchains - enabling transparancy and confidentiality

In supply chain, confidentiality is mandatory since some consumers might be given 
discounted rates compared to others. In this scenario, other consumers should not be able to access 
their competitors' rates. Given that Hyperledger Fabric is optimized for a broad range of 
industry use-cases, including supply chain, the open-source framework provides a way to implement 
confidentiality at the chaincode layer using attribute based access control. This example shows you 
how to implement such functionality, by registering and enrolling each user with a specific attribute, called "usertype".
To jump to the code that does this, go [here](https://github.com/IBM/fabric-contract-attribute-based-access-control/blob/master/application/server/utils.js#L220);
The "usertype" can be **admin**, **regulator**, **producer**, **shipper**, **retailer**, or **customer**. When that user logs in
successfully, and connects to an instance of the Hyperledger Fabric network, their "usertype" gives them access to certain transactions that have been submitted on the network. For example,
the **regulator** (such as the FDA) is able to view all transactions on the network in order to reliably audit
the network, but a **retailer** is only able to access assets and invoke transactions against assets which they are involved with. Once you
understand how to apply these access control rules, you can apply them to any use-case, and 
start building innovative, secure, blockchain networks. 

When the reader has completed this code pattern, they will understand how to:

1. Implement attribute based access control in Hyperledger Fabric
2. Build a chaincode in which certain users have access to certain transactions
3. Use an Angular UI to interact with a Hyperleder Fabric network.

![Application Flow Diagram](https://media.github.ibm.com/user/1650/files/e90b7280-6d0f-11ea-84f5-cf4d95e45b64)

## Flow Description
1) The user interacts with an Angular Web UI to update and query the blockchain ledger and state
2) The UI calls Node.js application APIs running on a backend server
3) The Node.js application server calls Fabric SDK APIs [see documentation here](https://hyperledger.github.io/fabric-sdk-node/release-1.4/index.html)
4) The Fabric SDK interacts with and submits transactions to a deployed IBM Blockchain Platform 2.0 or a Hyperledger Fabric 1.4.1 network

The value of running this network on the IBM Blockchain Platform is that one can easily customize the network infrastructure as needed, whether that is the location of the nodes, the CPU and RAM of the hardware, the endorsement policy needed to reach consensus, or adding new organizations and members to the network.

## Prerequisites (Local)
If you want to run this pattern locally, without any Cloud services, then all you need is VSCode and the
IBM Blockchain Platform extension. 
- [Install VSCode version 1.39](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- [Install IBM Blockchain Platform Extension for VSCode](https://github.com/IBM-Blockchain/blockchain-vscode-extension)
- [Node v8.x or greater and npm v5.x or greater](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
# Steps (Cloud Deployment)
> To run a cloud network, you can find steps [here](https://github.com/IBM/fabric-contract-role-based-access-control/blob/master/README.md#ibm-blockchain-platform-steps).

# Steps (Hyperledger Fabric Local Deployment)
1. [Clone the Repo](#step-1-clone-the-repo)
2. [Start the Fabric Runtime](#step-2-start-the-fabric-runtime)
3. [Install and Instantiate Contract](#step-3-install-and-instantiate-contract)
4. [Export Connection Details](#step-4-export-connection-details)
5. [Export Local Wallet](#step-5-export-local-wallet)
6. [Build and Run the App](#step-6-build-and-run-the-app)
7. [Submit transactions in the app](#step-7-submit-transactions-in-the-app)

## Step 1. Clone the Repo

Clone this repo onto your computer in the destination of your choice:
```
git clone https://github.com/IBM/fabric-contract-attribute-based-access-control.git
```
## Step 2. Start the Fabric Runtime

![startRuntime](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10428517/76370968-dea3ae80-62f5-11ea-8793-d04610e8bf30.gif)

- If you get errors like the gRPC error, you may need to download an earlier version of VSCode (1.39) [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_39). Note that if you are using Mac, make sure the VSCode in your /Applications
folder shows version 1.39 when you click on show details. You may need to 
move newer version into the trash, and then empty the trash for the older 
version to work.

- First, we need to go to our IBM Blockchain Extension. Click on the IBM Blockchain icon
  in the left side of VSCode (It looks like a square). 
- Next, start your local fabric by clicking on 
  *1 Org Local Fabric* in the **FABRIC ENVIRONMENTS** pane.
  
- Once the runtime is finished starting (this might take a couple of minutes), under *Local Fabric* you should see *Smart Contracts* and a section for both *installed* and *instantiated*.

## Step 3. Install and Instantiate Contract
![importContract](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10428517/76371236-e0ba3d00-62f6-11ea-82a1-bfa4798985b9.gif)
- Next, we have to import our contract before we can install it. Click on 
**View -> Open Command Pallette -> Import Smart Contract**. Next, click 
on the `gensupplychainnet@0.0.1.cds` file that is at the root of our directory.
This will be where you cloned this repo.

![installAndInstantiate](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10428517/76371514-bae16800-62f7-11ea-9038-039b0fac6967.gif)
- Now, let's click on *+ Install* and choose the peer that is available. Then the extension will ask you which package to 
 install. Choose *gensupplychainnet@0.0.1.cds*.
- Lastly, we need to instantiate the contract to be able to submit transactions 
on our network. Click on *+ Instantiate* and then choose *gensupplychainnet@0.0.1*.
- When promted for a function, a private data collection, or and endorsement 
policy, hit `enter` on your keyboard, which will take all of the defaults.
- This will instantiate the smart contract. This may take some time. You should see the contract under the *instantiated* tab on the left-hand side, once it 
is finished instantiating.

## Step 4. Export Connection Details
- Under `FABRIC GATEWAYS`, click on `1 Org Local Fabric - Org1` gateway.
- When asked to choose an identity to connect with, choose `admin`.
- Once you are connected, you should see `connected via gateway: 1 Org Local Fabric` 
under the `FABRIC GATEWAYS` tab as shown in the gif below.

![export](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10428517/76371002-fd09aa00-62f5-11ea-9f6b-cc25e68c410e.gif)

- To export your connection profile, right click on the 3 dot menu on the **FABRIC GATEWAYS** pane and `Export Connection Profile` Save this file to fabric-contract-attribute-based-access-control/gateway/local/fabric_connection.json. 

## Step 5. Export Local Wallet
![wallet](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10428517/76375176-65f71f00-6302-11ea-8071-d68192905a91.gif)
- 🚨Under the `FABRIC WALLETS` pane, click on `1 Org Local Fabric - Org1 Wallet`. Note this is very important, if you click on the Orderer wallet at the top, 
the application will not work! 🚨
- Export and save the wallet to `fabric-contract-attribute-based-access-control/gateway/local/gen_local_wallet`
- Once you're done exporting the wallet and the connection profile, your directory 
structure should look like below:

![dirStruct](https://media.github.ibm.com/user/79254/files/21cb6200-645b-11ea-8dbd-00806fc391a8)

## Step 6. Build and Run the app

- Next, let's install the server-side app. Navigate to 
`fabric-contract-attribute-based-access-control/application/server` and run 
`npm install`.
- Next, we need to install the UI dependencies. Navigate to 
`fabric-contract-attribute-based-access-control/application/client` and run `npm install`.

![buildandRunapp](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10428517/76376047-8b852800-6304-11ea-87b2-db6043e6e7cf.gif)

- Navigate to 
`fabric-contract-attribute-based-access-control/application/server` and run `node server.js` to connect start the API server to the fabric network. 
- Navigate to 
`fabric-contract-attribute-based-access-control/application/client` and run `ng serve` to run the Angular app.
- Go to localhost:4200 to view the app.

## Step 7. Submit transactions in the app

### Test Scenario - automatic, using curl against API server
